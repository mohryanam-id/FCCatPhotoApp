# Step 2

The **h1** through **h6** heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance so **h2** elements have less importance than **h1** elements. Only use one **h1** element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

Below the element, add an **h2** element with this text:

```txt
Cat Photos
```

## Before

```html
<h1></h1>
```

## After

```html
<h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
<h2>Cat Phtos</h2>
```
